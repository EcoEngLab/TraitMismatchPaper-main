# Git repository for the mismatch - thermal niche paper

This repository contains all data and code for the manuscript on the effects of thermal mismatches on arthopod fitness. This includes the manuscript's Latex source code. 

The Manuscript can be edited locally on your computer after cloning this repository (provided you have write/push access), or "locally" on Overleaf [here](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5cd07a4680045054bb2c9b90), where it is synced bidirectionally (you might want to [read this](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Using_Git_and_GitHub#Synchronizing_with_GitHub)). Please make sure that you git checkout or pull before making changes in any local. Specifically, 

* **When editing on your local machine**: Before making any changes to anything (including manuscript text), please use 
   * `git status` to check if there are any local changes that you have forgotten about, and  
   * `git checkout`  and/or `git pull` to update your local repository
   * Then `git commit` and `git push` after you are done. 
* **When editing on Overleaf**: Before making any changes,
  * Click on "Menu", and then "github", and then sync with the master repository on github if needed, and then, after finishing,
  * sync with github again the same way 

*Happy coding/writing for this exciting paper!*
