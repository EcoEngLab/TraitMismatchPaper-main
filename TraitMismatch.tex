\section*{Abstract}

Widespread concerns about climate-driven changes in the population dynamics of economically-important arthropods such as disease vectors, pests, and pollinators have led to growing interest in understanding and predicting the effect of climatic variation on arthropod abundances.  Arthropod population dynamics are strongly driven by environmental temperature. Many arthropod species also have stage-structured life histories which experience distinct thermal environments or differ inherently in their thermal physiology. Currently, we lack a quantitative framework for predicting how life stage-specific differences impact temperature-driven arthropod population dynamics. In this study, we combine life-history and ecological metabolic theory to model the intrinsic growth rate of arthropod populations under different levels of ``mismatch'' between the thermal responses of adult and juvenile life history traits. We show that mismatches between juvenile and adult trait thermal responses result in predictable shifts in the population level thermal optimum and niche width of fitness. Our analysis finds  a 1$^\circ$C increase in temperature mismatch between thermal responses can increase the population thermal optimum by xx, and thermal niche breadth between xx-xx percent. We empirically ground these theoretical results by performing a data-synthesis to show that thermal mismatches are likely to be common across the major arthropod taxa. Our study highlights the importance of physiological mismatches between different life stages in arthropod populations, need for empirical data, and further theoretical work on how life stage-specific thermal mismatches may amplify the effects of climate change on insect populations.

\section*{Introduction}

Arthropods constitute approximately three-quarters of all known biological organisms and inhabit virtually every known ecosystem. This group of animals is enormously important to the ecological health of the planet. For humans, this group is economically beneficial. Insects alone are estimated to provide more than  \$57 billion in ecosystems services to the US economy \citep{Losey2006}. At the same time, arthropods also represent one of the largest threats to human health and livelihood. Vector-borne diseases (VBDs), which are almost exclusively transmitted by arthropods, constitute approximately 17\% of infectious human disease incidence worldwide \citep{WHO2004}. In addition to directly impacting human health, many vector-borne plant diseases threaten food security \citep{Nault1997, Childers2003, Kitajima2003, Rodrigues2003}. 

Arthropod populations are currently experiencing dramatic changes in abundance. A recent study, reported that the current rates of decline will lead to the extinction of 40\% of the world's insect species over the next few decades. Climate has been identified as an important driver of these declines (cite?). Predictions of how climate change will alter future population abundances of these animals will require new methods for understanding how temperature alters population growth dynamics. 

Arthropod metabolic traits are directly dependent on changes in environmental temperature \citep{Tabachnick2010,Amarasekare2012a}. Therefore, temperature variation strongly affects their population growth rate and abundance \citep{Amarasekare2012a,Angilletta2009}. The stage-structured life-cycles of arthropods make it particularly challenging to understand the temperature dependence of their population dynamics because temperature often affects life history traits of different life stages (e.g., fecundity, mortality and development rate) in different ways \citep{Amarasekare2013,Mordecai2012,Dell2011a,Parham2010,Lunde2013}. 

Such stage-specific differences are expected to be common because traits may not only differ inherently in their underlying thermal physiology (e.g., juvenile development vs. adult mortality rate), but also because different life-stages experience different thermal regimes \citep{Kingsolver2020}. For example, the juvenile stages of mosquitoes develop in water, which may be as much as 6 $^\circ$C warmer than the environment experienced by adults \citep{Paaijmans2010d}, while the juvenile stages of tsetse flies ({\it Glossina} spp.) partly develop in the adult female and partly in the soil, which may be significantly warmer than air temperature \citep{Kleynhans2014}. Immature stages will typically be more affected as their lower motility results in a more limited ability to escape stressful temperatures than adults. The effects of differences in adult and juvenile thermal responses (Thermal Performance Curves, TPCs) of traits (or ``physiological mismatches'') remain largely unexplored theoretically and empirically \citep{Kingsolver2020}.

Currently the effects of stage-specific thermal niches or responses on population fitness have mainly been studied in fish \citep{Dahlke2020}, with very little data or theory on this topic in arthropods [REFS]. Here, we combine life-history and metabolic theory to model effects of physiological mismatches on  the intrinsic growth rate of arthropod populations. Intrinsic growth rate is a key parameter that quantifies exponential growth rate in population abundance \citep{Birch1948, Savage2004d, Amarasekare2012a}. Using this model, we assess the effect of mismatches between adult and juvenile TPCs on the thermal optimum and niche width of the TPC of population growth rate (Fig \ref{fig:TPCModel}). While previous studies have focused on the thermal optimum, thermal niche width is also key for understanding arthropod  population dynamics in natural environments, where temperatures fluctuate over space and time \citep{Paaijmans2010d,Paaijmans2013}. We then use the model to quantify the relative contribution of juvenile vs. adult stage thermal sensitivities to population growth rate.

\section*{Methods} 

\subsection*{The population growth rate model}

Our growth model is based on the assumption that the population has a stable age distribution (SAD, i.e., the proportion of individuals in adult and juvenile life stages is constant). Under the SAD assumption the Euler-Lotka equation gives the expected reproductive success of a newborn individual in a population that growing at a rate $r_\text{m}$ \citep{Charnov1993a, Savage2004d, Amarasekare2012a, Amarasekare2013}:

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:EuLot}
	\int_\alpha^\infty  {{e^{ - {r_\text{m}}x}}{l_x}{b_x}dx}  = 1	
\end{equation}

Here, $\alpha$ is the age at first reproduction (development time; days needed for development from egg to adult), $l_x$ is age-specific survivorship (proportion of individuals that survive from birth to age $x$), and $b_x$ the age-specific fecundity (number of offspring produced by an individual of age $x$). 

Using the simplest feasible mortality and fecundity models (for $l_x$ and $b_x$ respectively) for insects, we then show that (Supplementary Information 1):
\begin{equation} \label{eq:rm_app}
	r_m \approx \frac{(\kappa + z)  \left( \log\left(\frac{b_\text{opt}}{\kappa + z} \right) - \alpha z_J\right)}{\alpha (\kappa + z) + 1}
\end{equation}
where $x_\text{opt}$ is the age of peak fecundity $b_\text{opt}$, $\kappa$ is age-specific fecundity loss rate (controls spread of the fecundity  schedule), $z_J$ is mortality rate averaged across all juvenile stages, and $z$ is adult mortality rate (SI1). Substituting models of the TPCs of these life history traits (see below) then gives the temperature dependence of $r_\text{m}$ (Table \ref{tab:traits}).


\subsection*{Temperature-dependence of life history traits}

Next we substitute the thermal responses of the component traits of $r_\text{m}$ (\ref{tab:traits}). We model each trait's temperature dependence using a modified Sharpe-Schoolfield equation \citep{Schoolfield1981}: 
   
\begin{equation} \label{eq:TPCModel}
B = B_0 \dfrac
{	e^{\dfrac{-E_\text{}}{k} \left (\dfrac{1}{T} - 
\dfrac{1}{T_\text{ref}} \right ) } }
{1 + \dfrac{E}{E_\text{D} - E}  e^{\dfrac{E_\text{D}}{k}  
\left (\dfrac{1}{T_\text{opt}} - \dfrac{1}{T} \right )}}
\end{equation}
Here, $B$ is the value of the metabolic trait at a given temperature $T$ (K), $B_{0}$ is a normalisation constant representing the value of the trait at some reference temperature $T_\text{ref}$, $E$ is the ``activation  energy'' (eV) which controls the rise of the curve up to the peak (initial thermal sensitivity), $T_\text{opt}$ is the temperature at which the trait value or rate is maximised, and $E_\text{D}$ is the de-activation energy (eV), which determines the rate at which the trait declines after the peak. The parameter $k$ is the universal Boltzmann constant ($8.617 \cdot 10^{-5}$ eV  $K^{-1}$). The constant $B_0$ also includes the effect of body size, and therefore the effect of stage-specific size differences.       

\begin{figure}[H] 
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = .8\textwidth]{results/TPCModel.pdf}
	\caption{{\bf Illustration of the thermal performance curve (TPC) of vector life-history traits. A:} A Sharpe-Schoolfield model was used to generate TPCs for traits that are rates (peak fecundity rate, $b_\text{opt}$ and fecundity loss rate $\kappa$). {\bf B:} The inverse of this model (inverse of the curve in A) was used to generate TPCs for times (e.g., development time, $a$) or  non-unimodal rates (e.g., mortality rates $z$ and $z_J$). See Table \ref{tab:traits} for the list of traits. The vertical dotted line  marks $T_\text{opt}$ (the thermal optimum).}
\label{fig:TPCModel}
\end{figure} 

Equation \eqref{eq:TPCModel} has been used as a model for thermal performance of traits in numerous previous studies on athropod  \citep[e.g.,][]{Molnar2013} \citep[e.g.,][]{Dell2011a,Pawar2016}\todonum{Need another couple of references that don't come from Pawarlab}   population biology because it accurately captures the temperature dependence of a wide range of metabolic traits. Using different unimodal models instead of the Sharpe-Schoolfield model, such as Bri\`{e}re-type or polynomial models is also possible  \citep{Mordecai2012,Johnson2015,Mordecai2017}. We found that they do not qualitatively change the effect of mismatches on growth rate TPCs, niche width, or sensitivity of growth rate to underlying traits. For mortality rates (z and zj), we use the inverse of equation \eqref{eq:TPCModel}, because the thermal response of mortality rate (or inverse of proportion surviving) tends to be u-shaped \citep{Lunde2013,Mordecai2012,Johnson2015}.         

\subsubsection*{Parameterization}

Initially parameters were based on a previously published values for development, mortality, and  \citep[e.g.,][]{Mordecai2012}. We tested the robustness of the conclusions to changes in these parameters by varying B0 between for each trait and running the model 1000 times . We fixed the shape of all the TPCs to be the same except for $B_0$ and $T_\text{opt}$. $B_0$ was varied to achieve the appropriate magnitude for mosquitoes, consistent with the published literature on mosquito trait TPCs \citep{Mordecai2012, Johnson2015}.  $T_\text{opt}$ was varied to model mismatches, as described in the next section. Fig. \ref{fig:TPCModel} illustrates the two main shapes of TPCs resulting from these parameterizations. 

\subsection*{Modelling effect of physiological mismatches on the growth rate TPC}

In order to investigate the effect of mismatches between thermal performance curves of adult and juvenile arthropod life stages on the temperature-dependence of arthropod population growth rate, we evaluated the model while varying the thermal optimum ($T_\text{opt}$) for all juvenile life history traits from -10 to + 10 $^\circ$C relative to the thermal optima of adult traits, which remained constant at 26$^\circ$C. In other words, we explored a 10 $^\circ$C mismatch between the thermal optima of adult and juvenile traits in both directions. This range encompasses a sufficiently wide range of ecological scenarios of differences between adult and juvenile environments. We assessed the impact of the the mismatch between juvenile and adult traits by determining the change in the temperature-dependence of vector population growth rate as measured by the change in thermal optimum ($T_\text{opt}$), peak vector population growth rate ($r_\text{opt}$), and thermal niche width.

\subsection*{Calculating the thermal optimum and niche width}

Substituting the TPCs for the traits into Equation (\ref{eq:rm_app}) yields the TPC of $r_\text{m}$, from which its thermal optimum $r_\text{opt}$ (henceforth, $T_{\text{opt},r_m}$) can be numerically calculated. The thermal niche width was then determined to be the range of temperature values for which $r_m$ is greater than or equal to zero, and therefore the population is either stable or growing.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = .7\textwidth]{results/r_TPC.pdf}
	\caption{Illustration of the thermal niche of arthopod populations. We define the thermal niche of a population as the range of temperatures for which the population growth rate ($r_\text{m}$) is great than or equal to zero. A population with a growth rate less than zero will decline towards extinction}
\label{fig:ThermalNiche}
\end{figure} 

\subsection*{Sensitivity of the growth rate TPC to underlying traits}

In order to determine the traits driving the sensitivity of the TPC for population growth rate to thermal mismatches between between juvenile and adult traits, we assess the sensitivity of the model to temperature dependence of each parameter.

This can be determined by using the chain rule to determine the relative contribution of the temperature dependence of each parameter to the temperature dependence of population growth rate. The relative contribution of a parameter can be expressed as the product of the partial derivative of population growth rate  ($r_\text{m}$) with respect to a parameter and the derivative of that parameter with respect to temperature:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:sensitivity}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}r_\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{d}T} = 
	\frac{\partial r_\mathrm{m}}{\partial b_{pk}} \frac{\mathrm{d}b_{pk}}{\mathrm{d}T} + 
	\frac{\partial r_\mathrm{m}}{\partial \alpha}\frac{\mathrm{d}\alpha}{\mathrm{d}T} + 
	\frac{\partial r_\mathrm{m}}{\partial z} \frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}T} +
	\frac{\partial r_\mathrm{m}}{\partial z_J} \frac{\mathrm{d}z_J}{\mathrm{d}T} + 
	\frac{\partial r_\mathrm{m}}{\partial \kappa} \frac{\mathrm{d}\kappa}{\mathrm{d}T} 
\end{equation}

Having evaluated these terms (SI section S5), we can plot the relative contribution of each parameter to the thermal performance curve for population growth rate. The sensitivity of population growth rate to the thermal sensitivity of each parameter can be assessed by the deviation of the line for the partial derivative with respect to each parameter from zero. Furthermore, terms in equation \eqref{eq:sensitivity} can be combined according to life stage the trait is associated with. In the case of our mosquito example, development rate and juvenile mortality are the juvenile traits while adult mortality, fecundity, and rate of loss of fecundity are the adult traits. These together  determine the relative contribution of the thermal sensitivity of each life stage to the thermal sensitivity of population growth rate.

\section*{Results}
Mismatches between juvenile and adult trait thermal performances have significant impacts on the predicated absolute peak and thermal optimum of population growth rate ($r_m$ ,Fig. \ref{fig:ThermMM}). 

When juvenile traits peak at lower temperatures than adult traits (scenarios indicated in blue in Fig. \ref{fig:ThermMM}) , the thermal optimum of population growth shifts  to  lower temperatures (Fig. \ref{fig:ThermMM}B). The thermal optimum ($T_\text{opt}$) (Fig. \ref{fig:ThermMM}B) increases asymptotically as the common thermal optimum of juvenile traits increases relative to that of adults.  In this part of the curve, a $1^\circ$ C change in the amount of mismatch leads to a $xx^\circ$ C decrease in the thermal optimum of $r_m$. Once juvenile traits being to peak at higher temperatures than adult traits, the greater the mismatch between them, the higher the the thermal optimum of population growth becomes (scenarios indicated in red in Fig. \ref{fig:ThermMM}) In these scenarios, the effect on $r_m$ is less pronounced and it increases by $xx^\circ$ C for each $1^\circ$ C in mismatch. For the range of mismatches we explore ($-10^\circ$C to $+10^\circ$C) , $T_\text{opt}$ varies by about 12 $^\circ$C (~16 $^\circ$C - ~28 $^\circ$C). The asymptotic nature of this change is expected to be a general feature across species because even if the thermal optimum of juvenile traits increases, each adult trait inherently declines rapidly with temperature beyond the adult thermal optimum (Fig. \ref{fig:TPCModel}; Fig. Sxx).

Similarly, when juvenile traits peak at lower temperatures relative to adult traits, increasing mismatches decreases the peak value of $r_m$ . When juvenile traits peak higher than adult traits, the population growth rate peaks at a higher value ((Fig. \ref{fig:ThermMM}C). For the range of mismatches we explore ($-10^\circ$C to $+10^\circ$C)) , $r_\text{opt}$ varies from 0.15 to 0.40.This is because of the ``hotter-is-better'' constraint built into the Sharpe-Schoolfield model \citep{Schoolfield1981}. Optimal rates inexorably rise with thermal optimum because of thermodynamic constraints, which has been shown to hold across a wide range of insect species \citep{Frazier2006}. 

The thermal niche width, the range of temperatures for which the intrinsic population growth rate is non-negative (Fig. \ref{fig:ThermalNiche}), also changes in response to physiological mismatches between juvenile and adult traits (Fig. \ref{fig:ThermMM}D). When juvenile traits peak at temperatures lower that adult traits, increasing mismatches decrease the niche breadth from about 30 $^\circ$C to 20 $^\circ$C (Fig. \ref{fig:ThermMM}D) When juvenile traits peak at higher temperatures relative to adult traits, increasing mismatches increase the niche breadth from about 30 $^\circ$C to 20 $^\circ$C  . This response of niche width to mismatch magnitude is also an asymptotic response for the same reason as the response of the $T_\text{opt}$ explained above.

\end{figure} 

The magnitude of sensitivity of the growth rate TPC (both in terms of optimum and niche width) to magnitude of physiological mismatch is expected to vary with the relative contributions of the different adult and juvenile traits. We find that relative to adult traits, the temperature dependence of juvenile traits contribute more to the TPC of population growth rate (Fig. \ref{fig:r_sens}B) over a temperature range of 0--35$^\circ$C. This is largely driven by the contribution of juvenile development rate ($\alpha$), with juvenile mortality also having an increasing influence at extreme temperatures (Fig. \ref{fig:r_sens}A). This is also likely to be a fairly general result because arthropod population growth rates are typically expected depend strongly on juvenile development rate and mortality \citep{Birch1948}.

\section*{Discussion}
Many species of public health (), veterinary (), agricultural (), and conservation () importance are arthropods. As climate and land-use continue to shift and globalization continues to introduce new populations to new niches, there is a pressing need for tool to predict how these populations will respond to environmental variables such as temperature. Here we investigated a how taking into account a common component of arthropod life history, mismatches between the thermal environments and traits responses of adult and juvenile traits would be predicted to effect population growth rates. Using a mechanistic model, we found that when adult and juvenile traits mismatch, particularly when juvenile traits peak at lower temperatures than adult traits, there can be important changes in the predicated peak, thermal optimum, and niche breadth of population growth. 

Our data synthesis indicates that these mismatches.....in actual arthropod populations of importance. 

Our results highlight the  potential importance of stage-specific differences in environmental niche to vector population dynamics. Assuming that the thermal optimum and niche width of traits of different life stages reflect (through life history adaptation and phenotypic plasticity or acclimation) the local environmental temperature range experienced by those stages, quantifying the effects of mismatches in this way provides a new and important tool for understanding the effects of climate change on population dynamics of disease vectors. Such differences in the temperatures experienced by different life stages are expected to be common in arthropods. 

Furthermore, our modelling framework provides a relatively simple approach for incorporating a mechanistic model of thermal dependence of abundance intro disease transmission models. By not requiring complex simulations of stage-structured vector population dynamics, this model may facilitate the projection of vector population dynamics, and by extension, epidemiological measures such as $R_0$, across geographical and environmental space. The incorporation of physiological mismatches in this framework may also contribute to our understanding of vector population dynamics and the responses of vector populations, and by extension vector-borne disease dynamics, to a changing climate.

Our model indicates that across a broad range of temperatures, juvenile traits are more important than adult traits in determining the population growth rate of vectors, and that both the thermal optimum and peak vector population growth rate are sensitive to thermal mismatches between juvenile and adult life stages. In the case of this particular vector (mosquito) and parameterizations used here to illustrate the framework, we find that  this is largely driven by the contribution of juvenile development rate ($\alpha$), with juvenile mortality also having an increasing influence at extreme temperatures (Fig. \ref{fig:r_sens}A). This is likely to be a fairly general result because arthropod population growth rates typically depend strongly on juvenile development rate and mortality \hlfix{[Refs]}.

\hlfix{Our framework requires data on the thermal responses of a small set of key, commonly-measured life history parameters, and in principle, should be applicable to any vector population with stage-structured life history. However, to confidently fit appropriate TPCs, we would need robust data covering an appropriate range of temperatures, which is difficult to achieve. Furthermore, for many species of disease vector the data for the full complement of traits has not been published.}

A notable absence for all species of vector is data on the rate of loss of fecundity ($\kappa$), and especially how this trait responds to temperature. A experimental study by \citet{Stavrinides2011} showed that the fecundity schedule for three species of mite are sensitive to temperature.

\hlfix{The results of this study indicate that the differences in the environmental conditions experienced by juvenile and adult lifestages of vectors warrent greater consideration. This is especially true when considering the impact of temperature on vector populations, such as in the context of climate change and the shifting geographic distributions of vectors and the pathogens they transmit.}{Highlighted passages are work in progress}
